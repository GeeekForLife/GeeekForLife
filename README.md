# Hi, I'm Geek! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about science, specifically biology, chemistry, and computer science. I'm constantly learning in these fields as I aspire to pursue a career in one of them.

## What I'm Currently Up To 🌱

I'm actively expanding my knowledge and skills in biology, chemistry, and computer science. I believe in lifelong learning and enjoy exploring new concepts, technologies, and discoveries. I'm excited about the possibilities these fields offer and the potential they have to shape the future.

## Collaboration and Domains 🤝🌐

I'm interested in collaborating with individuals who share my values of compassion, understanding, honesty, and positivity. Together, we can create meaningful projects and contribute to the greater good.

I recently acquired two domains, [DMTGeek.com](https://www.dmtgeek.com) and [PhenoGeek.com](https://www.phenogeek.com). While I have some general ideas in mind, I'm eager to learn how to bring them to life. If you have expertise in web development, design, or any related area, I'd love to connect and explore possibilities together.
